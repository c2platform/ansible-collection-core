# Ansible Role: Boostrap

Supplements `robertdobock.bootstrap` with `bootstrap_packages_extra`. 

Role `robertdobock.bootstrap` uses `vars` in `vars` folder. These should not be used because the Ansible community did a poor job on this. See [What's the difference between defaults and vars in an Ansible role?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29127560/whats-the-difference-between-defaults-and-vars-in-an-ansible-role/58078985#58078985)
